# Why Tributary?

Recurring payments are fundamental to modern business, but Web3 has struggled to match the simplicity users expect from Web2 services. Tributary solves this by providing the infrastructure that makes automated payments as easy in Web3 as they are in traditional finance.

## üî¥ The Problem: Web3 Payments Are Broken

### For Users

- **Manual Transaction Hell:** Users must manually sign transactions every billing period
- **Fund Lock-up Risk:** Many solutions require depositing funds into smart contracts
- **Poor User Experience:** Complex flows hurt conversion rates and adoption
- **No Payment Control:** Limited ability to pause, modify, or track subscriptions

### For Businesses

- **Revenue Unpredictability:** Manual payments lead to churn and missed payments
- **Development Complexity:** Building payment infrastructure from scratch is expensive
- **Limited Flexibility:** Existing solutions don't support diverse business models
- **Integration Challenges:** Difficult to connect with existing business systems

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Tributary Protocol

### True Automation

Users sign **once** and payments flow automatically. No more monthly transaction signing, no more missed payments due to user friction.

!!! warning "üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress. Tributary is under active development and interfaces may change at any time.""

```typescript
// User experience: One signature enables automatic payments
await tributarySDK.createSubscription({
  amount: new BN(10_000_000), // $10 USDC
  interval: PaymentInterval.Monthly,
  recipient: merchantWallet,
  maxRenewals: 12, // Auto-renew for 1 year
});
// That's it! Payments now flow automatically
```

### No Fund Lock-up

Unlike other solutions, Tributary doesn't require users to deposit funds into smart contracts. Payments come directly from user token accounts using Solana's native delegation feature.

**Traditional Approach:**

```
User Wallet ‚Üí Smart Contract (locked funds) ‚Üí Periodic withdrawals ‚Üí Merchant
‚ùå Funds locked, withdrawal risk, complexity
```

**Tributary Approach:**

```
User Wallet ‚Üí Direct automated payments ‚Üí Merchant
‚úÖ Funds stay in user control, payments still automatic
```

### Complete Flexibility

Support any business model with configurable payment policies:

- **Subscriptions:** Netflix-style recurring payments
- **Installments:** Buy-now-pay-later functionality
- **Usage-Based:** Variable amounts based on consumption
- **Donations:** Patreon-style creator support
- **Membership Dues:** Annual or periodic membership payments

## üöÄ Why Protocol Architecture?

### For Developers & Businesses

Instead of building payment infrastructure from scratch, use Tributary's battle-tested protocol and focus on your unique value proposition.

**Without Tributary:**

```
Months of development ‚Üí Custom smart contracts ‚Üí Security audits ‚Üí
User interface ‚Üí Payment monitoring ‚Üí Error handling ‚Üí Ongoing maintenance
```

```
npm install @tributary-so/sdk ‚Üí Build your unique features ‚Üí Launch

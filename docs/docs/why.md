# Why

We want to simplify the use of recurring payments for services and later be
able to extend this for subscriptions similar to what stripe offers in the
web2 space.

Users want to be able to pay services, or donate on a regular basis without
having to bother about it. They also want a place where they can see all their
approved recurring payments and manage them.

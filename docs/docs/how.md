# How Tributary Works

Tributary enables automated recurring payments on Solana through token delegation - users approve payments once, and the protocol handles execution automatically.

## üîÑ Payment Flow

1. **User Approval**: User delegates spending authority to Tributary smart contracts for specific amounts and schedules
2. **Policy Creation**: Flexible payment policies define when and how much to pay
3. **Automated Execution**: Smart contracts process payments according to the agreed schedule
4. **Direct Transfer**: Funds move directly from user token accounts to recipients

## üéØ For Different Audiences

### End Users

**Supported Payment Types:**

- Subscriptions (fixed recurring amounts)
- Installments (scheduled partial payments)
- Usage-based (variable amounts by consumption)
- Membership dues (regular membership fees)
- Donations (ongoing creator support)

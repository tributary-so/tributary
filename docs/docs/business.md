// Provider builds on Tributary SDK
import { Tributary } from "@tributary-so/sdk";

class SubscriptionProvider {
  async createSubscription(params) {
    // Use Tributary protocol

    // Provider-specific features
    await this.sendWelcomeEmail(result.user);
    await this.setupWebhooks(result.subscriptionId);

  }

  async handlePayment(paymentEvent) {
